Smart Home Device Manager
This project simulates a smart home system that manages various devices like Lights, Cameras, and Heaters.
Each device can be turned on or off, and specific settings can be adjusted when a device is powered on.


Devices and Behaviors:

Lights can change brightness and color when active.

Cameras can adjust their angle and start/stop recording when turned on.

Heaters allow temperature adjustments within a specified range when operational.


Initial Setup:

4 Lights (IDs 0-3) start ON, with low brightness and yellow color.

2 Cameras (IDs 4-5) start ON, at a 45° angle, and not recording.

4 Heaters (IDs 6-9) start ON, each set to 20°C.


Device Rules:

Only Lights and Cameras are chargeable.

Lights' colors can be either YELLOW or WHITE.

Brightness can be LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH.

Cameras' angles must stay within -60° to 60°.

Heaters' temperature must stay between 15°C and 30°C.

If a device is OFF, its settings can't be changed (except for charging).


Supported Commands:

DisplayAllStatus – Show the status of all devices.

TurnOn, TurnOff – Switch a device's power state.

StartCharging, StopCharging – Control device charging.
